                <p><b>1.</b> Fandom PokePartners only accepts fictional characters only. While 'fictional' can be a very broad term, any characters depicted in live-action are allowed, but any real life people (including actors, voice actors, musicians, etc.) will not be accepted without notification. Fandom PokePartners wishes to maintain and respects freedom of choice for these individuals, unless if these individuals reach out and give consent to be added. Likewise, any actors that are depicting themselves in a fictious manner will be denied for the same reasons as mentioned above, unless consent is given. <!--  Examples:<br>

                <p><b>2.</b> Fandom PokePartners does not allow suggestions based on media that are sexually explicit in nature. Characters from adult-oriented content such as M-rated games and R-rated TV Shows and movies are allowed, but characters from specific media that are prohibited from younger audiences will not be accepted. If the source series is banned on Steam and/or needs an ID to access the material, it will not be accepted here. Any source material that contains sexual themes, such as ecchi anime series, will be accepted as long as it is not explicit and/or the depicted character is appropriate for audience viewing. <!-- Examples:<br>
